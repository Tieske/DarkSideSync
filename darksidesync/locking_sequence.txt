proper luastate shutdown;
=========================
will go through garbage collect at luastate shutdown

- utility list is stored in library static data
- data queue is stored in globaldata per luastate

get globaldata from lua registry
lock
set status to stopping   >> any utils will now get errors
unlock  >> allow any waiting utils to actually get the error
unregister all utilities for this luastate (might require lock/unlock actions)
  --> there is no async access because access to globaldata is through utilrecord
      which were all just removed
lock
dispose of mutexes and sockets in globaldata
remove references from registry to API and globaldata
done!

proper overall shutdown;
========================
when networkcount reaches 0, the static data must be disposed of
lock
clear everything
unlock
destroy lock     --> the last two lines are not safe, another thread myght claim the
